<li>But making a report to the police may be difficult. If you need help reporting to police contact [Drop down box of contacts for CSOs] and if you don't feel comfortable reporting it, you don't have to. You may prefer to get advice about what to do from an experienced adult who can be sympathetic to you. Do whatever helps you to feel safe and heal without blaming yourself. </li>

<p style="text-align:justify">
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>40% of rape survivors develop sexually transmitted diseases as a result of sexual assault.</li>
<li>You should get medical attention right away without changing your clothes, showering, douching, or washing. It can be hard not to clean up, of course — it's a natural human instinct to wash away all traces of a sexual assault. But being examined right away is the best way to ensure you get proper medical treatment.</li>
<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('foo');">More/Less</a>
<div id="foo" style="display:none;">
<li>Immediate medical attention helps when people decide to report the crime, providing evidence needed to prosecute the rapist if a criminal case is pursued. If you've been raped and think you don't want to report it, you could change your mind later and having the results of a medical exam can help you do this.</li>
<li>Even if you don't get examined right away, it doesn't mean you can't get a checkup later. It's always best to see a doctor immediately after a rape, of course. But a person can still go to a doctor or local clinic to get checked out for STDs, pregnancy, or injuries any time after being raped. In some cases, doctors can even gather evidence several days after a rape has occurred.</li>
<li>A medical professional will test you for STDs, including HIV/AIDS. These tests may involve taking blood or saliva samples. Although the thought of getting an STD after a rape is extremely scary, the quicker a person finds out about any infection, the more effectively he or she can be treated. Doctors can start you on immediate treatment courses for STDs, including HIV/AIDS that will greatly increase your protection against developing these diseases.
</li>
<p style="text-align:justify">All doctors and nurses will deal with your medical needs confidentially, and they will not inform anyone without your consent.</p>

<div id="foo" style="display:none;">
<li>Rape survivors are 13 times more likely to attempt suicide than are people who have not been victims of a crime.</li>
<li>Rape isn't just physically damaging, it can be emotionally traumatic as well. The right emotional attention, care, and support can you begin the healing process and prevent lingering problems later on.</li>
<li>Someone who has been raped might feel a lot of things: angry, degraded, frightened, numb, or confused. It's also normal for someone who has been raped to feel ashamed or embarrassed. Some people withdraw from friends and family. Others don't want to be alone. Some feel depressed, anxious, or nervous.</li>
<li>Sometimes the feelings surrounding rape may show up in physical ways, such as trouble sleeping or eating. It may be hard to concentrate in school or to participate in everyday activities. Sometimes it may feel like you'll never get over the trauma of the rape. Experts often refer to these emotions and their physical side effects as rape trauma syndrome. The best way to work through them is with professional help.</li>

				<h2>Help teens define their personal rights</h2>
							</header>
<p style="text-align:justify">Believe it or not, many teens who get caught up in an inappropriate relationship with an adult (or even someone their own age who is an abuser) blame themselves. They do not know what their personal rights are or what kind of behavior to expect from adults. Teach your children that it is okay to say no and that they do not have to do anything they do not want to do. Often, kids think they are supposed to respect their elders and be nice, so they go along with things that make them uncomfortable because they feel obligated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
<p><b>Teens should understand that: </b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Their bodies are theirs.</li>
<li>Past permission does not obligate them to future activity.</li>

<li>Pornography is not an accurate depiction of real life.</li>
<li>They deserve to be spoken to with respect and never feel coerced.</li>
<li>Alcohol and drugs may make it hard for them to maintain their boundaries and can cloud their judgment.</li>
